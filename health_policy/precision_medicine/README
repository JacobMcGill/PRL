Folder to hold materials related to Precision Medicine project.

Precision medicine, in the context of AI, leverages advanced algorithms to analyze vast amounts of patient data, including genetic, molecular, and clinical information. AI models can identify patterns, predict treatment outcomes, and recommend personalized therapies based on an individualâ€™s unique health profile. Machine learning techniques help refine diagnoses, optimize treatment plans, and even discover new drug candidates by processing complex biomedical data. This AI-driven approach accelerates research, improves accuracy in disease prediction, and supports more effective, tailored medical interventions.

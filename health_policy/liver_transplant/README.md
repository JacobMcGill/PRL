In an era marked by the increasing prevalence of tattoos and their evolving 
societal perception, this study investigates the role of tattoo parlors as 
potential contributors to nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). While 
well-established risk factors, such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, and high 
blood pressure, have been linked to NAFLD, the impact of tattoos and their 
associated complications on liver health remains relatively unexplored. 
Utilizing a multiple linear regression model and state-level data, our research
aims to uncover the relationship between the density of tattoo parlors and live
health. This study calls for a more comprehensive understanding of the 
multifaceted risk factors associated with NAFLD, as the prevalence of tattoos 
continues to rise, and underscores the need for informed policy development to
address this dynamic landscape.

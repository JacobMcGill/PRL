(Charles 9/6/24 notes)

This project looks at the growth of the venture capital asset class, and uses statistical analysis to uncover whether this future growth is sustainable.

The growth of VC (90s - 2021): Starting in the late 90s, we’ve seen venture capital investment take more and more share in institutional portfolios. Pioneers in alternative asset allocation like David Swensen, CIO of the Yale endowment fund, saw outsized returns from venture capital investments. More dollars got poured into startup investments, and in lockstep, startups saw increased success.
The current trend (2021 - present): In 2021, partly driven from macro trends and partly driven from the backdrop VCs and startups gave up until then, we saw 2021 get a huge influx of VC investment. We also saw a lot of exits happen in VC, which are IPOs and M&A. This growth has proven to not be the norm, but it was an important proof-point of how much interest is in the space.
Beyond 2021, there is another secular trend in the space, which is a class of VC firms that are ever-expanding. Just in the last year, we saw firms like A16Z and Thrive Capital raise more than $10 billion for their early and late-stage venture funds. Like any asset class, there is a concern as to whether these firms will be able to find quality companies to invest in and ultimately sustain “venture quality” returns. Some key factors that may influence this point include macro trends like interest rates and IPO activity, and firm-level trends such as M&A and R&D expenditure.
This project: First, we’ll give some context on venture capital, what types of companies they invest in, and then look at the returns and. The point of this project is to take a sober perspective to the asset class’ growth, and ultimately make the determination as to whether this growth is sustainable. Key factors we will use to make this determination are current trends in fundraising from a GP and LP perspective, in the macro economy, and trends other key stakeholders that make the venture capital ecosystem work, including M&A activity, IPOs, etc.

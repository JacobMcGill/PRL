Idea: Take a look at crossover funds, specifically the funds they raised in the late 2010s - 2021.
Then look at the deals they did, and specifically look at the valuations they invested at. Were the valuations on these investments really high?
If they were high, what were the implications of that? Did that make early-stage funds feel good about themselves, which then cuased them to raise their own fund in 2021?

Data to gather:

List of biggest crossover funds
Then for each crossover fund, find:

- The size and date of the fund they raised
- The specific deals they invested in, including the valuation (and previous valuation) on the company
  - If the valuations are "exit territory" for Series A investors, and statistically significantly higher than the average valuation for those rounds (in that sector), we can assume Tiger was basically paying way too high of prices...
- The CURRENT valuation of that company (i.e., how it's doing today)
- The EXISTING investors in those companies
- The funds those EXISTING investors have raised

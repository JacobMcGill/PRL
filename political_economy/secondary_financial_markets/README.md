## Project Background

Forecasting the Size of the Private Market: Trends and Insights
Ranak Bansal, Charles Miele, Mehar Poreddy, Maryam Saddiq

After the financial crisis in 2008, private market fundraising hit a 5-year low at roughly $287B on a global scale. Since then, growth has exploded at a CAGR greater than 12%. Fundraising has surpassed $1T in four of the past five years, with the only major hiccup due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Most recent data assessed the value of private market fundraising at $1.184T for 2021.

Despite this rapid growth, experts have raised concerns about its sustainability. The CAGR mentioned above can be attributed to an economically friendly environment cradled by the Federal Reserve’s 0-rate policy throughout the 2010s. However, as interest rates rise, private market returns have slowly come down to earth and resemble public markets more closely.

Given the need to narrow this project's scope, we decided to look closely at the venture market within the private sector. With $42.9B raised in 2Q24, VC dealmaking has continued to recover post-pandemic. This is primarily driven by AI/ML, which has driven nearly 50% of deal value in the US market. The concern of rising interest rates, which have recently been held steady, has been mainly reflected in the most recently available venture data. While the Fed has pointed towards lowering rates in the short term, these effects likely won’t materialize for several quarters. Even though valuations have been rising, this data reflects another typical economic cycle in which predictability is difficult.

The core approach for this project is divided into two parts: (1) “money-in” and (2) “money-out.” Essentially, we aim to identify the factors that affect capital and the return on that capital to create a comprehensive view of the market. By identifying both, we aim to develop a model that allows for inputs to predict the size of the VC landscape in the future.

On the “money-in” side, analysts and academics have been increasingly discussing fund allocation rates, given the increased risk and liquidity crunches of private market investing. Specifically, there is concern about whether asset managers will decrease their allocation rates for private markets, thereby altering the venture capital and private equity market landscapes. This could impact funding, exits, and market competitiveness. This will be a core aspect, along with macroeconomic factors, to better understand the available capital in venture over the next decade.

On the “money-out” side, we aim to measure fund performance on a yearly basis from 2007. With an average target lifetime of 10 years, we plan to look at fund returns annually, providing us with approximately 7 years of data. To account for the limited data, we plan to also look at the IPO market along with M&A activity and regulation to gain a better understanding for potential returns.

Accounting for both factors of the venture landscape helps account for the relationship between the two. It is expected that there is a relationship between available capital and capital returns, primarily due to market conditions. For example, dry powder tends to be highest during periods of economic downturn, whereas returns are highest during peak economic cycles.

(Charles 9/6/24 notes)

This project looks at the growth of the venture capital asset class, and uses statistical analysis to uncover whether this future growth is sustainable.

The growth of VC (90s - 2021): Starting in the late 90s, we’ve seen venture capital investment take more and more share in institutional portfolios. Pioneers in alternative asset allocation like David Swensen, CIO of the Yale endowment fund, saw outsized returns from venture capital investments. More dollars got poured into startup investments, and in lockstep, startups saw increased success.
The current trend (2021 - present): In 2021, partly driven from macro trends and partly driven from the backdrop VCs and startups gave up until then, we saw 2021 get a huge influx of VC investment. We also saw a lot of exits happen in VC, which are IPOs and M&A. This growth has proven to not be the norm, but it was an important proof-point of how much interest is in the space.
Beyond 2021, there is another secular trend in the space, which is a class of VC firms that are ever-expanding. Just in the last year, we saw firms like A16Z and Thrive Capital raise more than $10 billion for their early and late-stage venture funds. Like any asset class, there is a concern as to whether these firms will be able to find quality companies to invest in and ultimately sustain “venture quality” returns. Some key factors that may influence this point include macro trends like interest rates and IPO activity, and firm-level trends such as M&A and R&D expenditure.
This project: First, we’ll give some context on venture capital, what types of companies they invest in, and then look at the returns and. The point of this project is to take a sober perspective to the asset class’ growth, and ultimately make the determination as to whether this growth is sustainable. Key factors we will use to make this determination are current trends in fundraising from a GP and LP perspective, in the macro economy, and trends other key stakeholders that make the venture capital ecosystem work, including M&A activity, IPOs, etc.

# The Policy Research Laboratory (PRL)

PRL research projects are divided into three silos: Meta-Analysis, Political Economy and Health Policy.

Meta-Analysis: This silo focuses on assessing the robustness of the findings of other papers by testing for criteria such as p-hacking and replicability. It currently focuses on its replication project, replicating the key results of over 200 papers, to test their key findings.

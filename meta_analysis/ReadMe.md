# Replication Project

## Overview
The replication project seeks to determine the replicability of economic papers that use quantitative, analytical methods to answer social questions. To answer this question, each paper in our sample was analyzed for its data/code availability, as well as for its replicability in the original programming language and in Python. The original code replications have been completed, and we are in the process of completing the Python replications. 

## Objectives
- Determine data availability of social papers in economic journals
- Determine code availability of these papers
- Determine if these papers are replicable, and if replicability varies with programming language used

## Methodology
We collected a sample of 131 papers published in the American Economic Review that were written on social topics. Then, for each paper in the sameple, we recorded the degree to which the code and data were available. These papers were then replicated in their original programming language (often Stata). Papers that were fully replicable in their original language were then replicated in Python. For the Python replications, only the first two regression tables were attempted.

## Current State of the Project
The data/code availability analysis has been completed. All papers have been replicated in their original programming language. Currently, we are finishing the Python replications.

## Tools and Technologies
- Stata
- Python (Key Packages: Pandas, Numpy, Statsmodels)

## Findings (if applicable)
Of the 131 papers in the sample, 104 had complete code, 46 had complete data, and 16 were fully replicable in their original programming language. So far, of the 10 papers that were fully replicable in the original code and have been attepted in Python, 7 of them had results that matched the author's original analysis.
